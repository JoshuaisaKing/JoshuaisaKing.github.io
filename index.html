        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          A computer science enthusiast with a passion for automotive
          engineering, AI, and ML, I thrive at the intersection of technology
          and mobility. I am fascinated by how artificial intelligence and
          machine learning can revolutionize the automotive industry, from
          enabling autonomous driving systems to enhancing smart vehicle
          connectivity. With a blend of technical expertise in AI/ML and
          creative problem-solving, I am driven to innovate and push the
          boundaries of whatâ€™s possible in these cutting-edge fields.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>
          During my internship at Drobots Tech, I developed a front-end web
          application using React, tailored for end-users to order drone pickups
          and deliveries for various packages. This platform streamlined the
          process of scheduling drone services, catering to different package
          types such as medicine, regular parcels, and urgent deliveries.
          Leveraging the Google Maps API, I integrated a dynamic map interface,
          enabling users to easily select pickup and delivery locations with
          precision. To ensure a seamless experience, I designed intuitive
          functionalities, prioritizing user-friendliness and accessibility.
          This project not only honed my technical skills in React and API
          integration but also showcased my ability to create innovative
          solutions in the rapidly evolving drone technology space.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
          During my internship at Drobots Tech, I gained valuable experience
          working in a fast-paced startup environment. I collaborated with a
          dynamic team to solve real-world challenges, enhancing my technical
          and problem-solving skills. The role allowed me to apply my knowledge
          of web development and API integration to meaningful tasks. I also
          developed a deeper understanding of user-centric design and the
          importance of creating intuitive solutions. This experience
          strengthened my ability to work effectively under deadlines while
          contributing to innovative technological advancements.
